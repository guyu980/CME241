    "##  1. Problem Statement\n",
    "* You will live for (deterministic) $T$ more years, and your current wealth plus present value of future income is $W_0>0$.\n",
    "* You can invest in $n$ risky assets and a riskless asset and each asset has known normal distribution of returns. You are also allowed to long or short any fractional quantitiles of assetes.\n",
    "* You are trading in continuous time $0\\leq t<T$, with no transaction costs.\n",
    "* You can consume any fractional amount of wealth at any time.\n",
    "* Your goal is to maximize the life-time aggregated utility of consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. MDP of Merton's Problem:\n",
    "* State ${(t, W_t)}$ is the time step $t$ and the wealth $W_t$ at that time.\n",
    "* Action ${[\\pi_t, c_t]}$, where $\\pi_t$ denotes the amount spent in risky asset, $c_t$ denotes the amount on consumption.\n",
    "* Reward ${U(c_t)}$ is the utility of consumption at time $t$.\n",
    "* Return is the usual accumulated discounted reward.\n",
    "* Then we want to find policy: $(t, W_t) \\rightarrow [\\pi_t, c_t]$ that maximizes the expected retuen:\n",
